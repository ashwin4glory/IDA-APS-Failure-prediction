IDA 2016 Challenge
-------------------
++ About the data

+ Introduction

The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania 
trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the 
Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised 
air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, 
such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' 
positive class consists of component failures 
for a specific component of the APS system. 
The negative class consists of trucks with failures 
for components not related to the APS. The data consists 
of a subset of all available data, selected by experts.     


+ Attributes

The attribute names of the data have been anonymized for 
proprietary reasons. It consists of both single numerical 
counters and histograms consisting of bins with different 
conditions. Typically the histograms have open-ended 
conditions at each end. For example if we measuring 
the ambient temperature "T" then the histogram could 
be defined with 4 bins where: 

bin 1 collect values for temperature T < -20
bin 2 collect values for temperature T >= -20 and T < 0     
bin 3 collect values for temperature T >= 0 and T < 20  
bin 4 collect values for temperature T > 20 

 |  b1  |  b2  |  b3  |  b4  |   
 ----------------------------- 
       -20     0      20

The attributes are as follows: class, then 
anonymized operational data. The operational data have 
an identifier and a bin id, like "Identifier_Bin".
In total there are 171 attributes, of which 7 are 
histogram variabels. Missing values are denoted by "na".

+ Data characteristics

The data comes in two files, one training set which 
contain the class labels and a test set which has an 
additional id number for each example and "na" as 
class label. Both of these sets are sampled from the 
same source with stratification regarding the class, 
hence they should contain roughly the same distribution 
of faulty and non-faulty components.  

The training set contains 60000 examples in total in which 
59000 belong to the negative class and 1000 positive class. 
The test set contains 16000 examples.


++ Participating

+ Challenge
 
The challenge task is to come up with a good prediction model 
for judging whether or not a vehicle faces imminent failure 
of the specific component or not. The contestants should 
classify the test set, and send their predictions 
to "ida2016challenge@dsv.su.se". 
The prediction should be sent as an attachment, 
in at "txt" file format, each row in the file should 
be in the following format:

id_1, predicted_class_1
id_2, predicted_class_2
...
id_n, predicted_class_n
 
where the "id_1" should refer to an examples id of the 
test_set followed by the models prediction for this instance. 

Further must the competitors also write a paper describing 
the methods they used when creating their predictive model. 
It is encouraged that this paper is written in a 
clear and inspirational style in which they motivate their 
decision when developing their model. The papers should 
use the same template as the other papers in the conference, 
see, "ida2016.blogs.dsv.su.se" for more details.
 
+ Awards

The top contenders' papers will be published in the 
IDA 2016 proceedings and will be asked to hold an oral 
presentation at the conference. Scania who supplied the data, 
also sponsor a prize of 500 € divided into two awards.  

The two awards are:
"The best result", which goes to the authors/creators 
of the prediction model which achieves the lowest cost 
(see metric below) of all participants on the given test set.

And the "most innovative and interesting" approach 
when addressing the challenge. 

Note that these awards are not mutually exclusive so one 
approach could win them both.   

Deadline for sending in classifications and describing paper 
is 2016-07-01.


+ Challenge metric  

The contestants will be measure according to the following 
cost-metric of miss-classification:

Predicted class |	True class      |
		|    pos    |    neg    |
-----------------------------------------
		|           |           |
     pos        |     -     |  Cost_1   |
-----------------------------------------
                |           |           |
     neg        |  Cost_2   |     -     |
-----------------------------------------
Cost_1 = 10 and cost_2 = 500

The total cost of a prediction model the sum of "Cost_1" 
multiplied by the number of Instances with type 1 failure 
and "Cost_2" with the number of instances with type 2 failure, 
resulting in a "Total_cost".

In this case Cost_1 refers to the cost that an unnessecary 
check needs to be done by an mechanic at an workshop, while 
Cost_2 refer to the cost of missing a faulty truck, 
which may cause a breakdown.

Total_cost = Cost_1*No_Instances + Cost_2*No_Instances.
